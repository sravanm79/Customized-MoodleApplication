Feature: Test that answers changed after checking are highlighted as being different to the answer that was checked.
  As a teacher or student
  I must be able to see the "Results below are for a different answer to the answer above." message when an answer has changed after checking.

  Background:
    Given the CodeRunner test configuration file is loaded
    And I enable UI plugins in the CodeRunner question type
    And the following "users" exist:
      | username | firstname | lastname | email            |
      | teacher1 | Teacher   | 1        | teacher1@asd.com |
    And the following "courses" exist:
      | fullname | shortname | category |
      | Course 1 | C1        | 0        |
    And the following "course enrolments" exist:
      | user     | course | role           |
      | teacher1 | C1     | editingteacher |
    And the following "question categories" exist:
      | contextlevel | reference | name           |
      | Course       | C1        | Test questions |
    And the following "questions" exist:
      | questioncategory | qtype      | name                        | template     |
      | Test questions   | coderunner | Square function (with Ace)  | sqr_with_ace |

Scenario: Preview the Python3 sqr_with_ace function CodeRunner question get it right then change the answer and wait for changed answer notification
  When I am on the "Square function (with Ace)" "core_question > edit" page logged in as teacher1
  # Turn useace off so can change template to correct value (and useace back on after)
  And I set the following fields to these values:
    | id_useace      | 0        |
  And I wait "1" seconds
  #And I set the field with xpath "//textarea[contains(@id, 'id_template')]" to multiline:
  And I set the field "id_template" to multiline:
  """
  {{ STUDENT_ANSWER }}
  {{ TEST.testcode }}
  """
  And I set the following fields to these values:
    | id_useace      | 1        |
  # Need to change question name or else the preview step will find two qids for the same name
  # That is, it isn't looking for the latest version!!!!
  And I set the field "id_name" to "Square function (with Ace) v2"
  And I press "id_submitbutton"
  And I am on the "Square function (with Ace) v2" "core_question > preview" page logged in as teacher1
  And I wait until the page is ready
  # Aha, for scratchpad use "answer_code" but "answer" for ace...
  And I set the ace field "answer" to "def sqr(n): return n * n"
  And I press "Check"
  And I wait until the page is ready
  Then I should see "Passed all tests!"
  Then I should not see "Results below are for a different answer to the answer above."
  And I set the ace field "answer" to "def sqr(n): return n * n * n"
  # And I wait until the page is ready --- no use as page won't reload
  # And I wait "1" seconds --- may not wait long enough
  # So wait for a changed notice to come up
  #   Of course this wouldn't work if we had multiple elements on the page
  #   but we can't do this as the prefix to changed-notice would be unique and unknown....
  And I wait until "[data-id$='-changed-notice']" "css_element" exists
  Then I should see "Results below are for a different answer to the answer above."
  # still passing for old answer
  Then I should see "Passed all tests!"
